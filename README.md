## Note
I have taken images which are shown in the app from google, big-basket, and from other sources. These are just for demo purpose. If it is client project, I will get it done from UX team and use SVG.

## Project Description
This is grocery manager App in which everyday items are sold. Few of the functionalities of this app are mentioned below-

### Home Page
Products are listed on this page. There is a product image, product name, product info icon, and product price etc. Here, user can add products in her/his basket by clicking the 'Add To Cart' button. Also, user can increase or decrease item quantity by clicking the '+' or '-' buttons respectively. Each item has its own maximum quantities which user can her/his basket. Once maximum limit is reached user will get message - "Limited quantity available. You can't add more of this item".

### Shopping Cart
Here items which are added in user's basket(from the home page) are listed. User can increase or decrease the item quantity by clicking the '+' or '-' buttons respectively. Each item has its own maximum quantities which user can her/his basket. Once maximum limit is reached user will get message - "Limited quantity available. You can't add more of this item". Also, once the item quantity becomes zero, item is removed from the list. Additionally, user can click the 'delete icon'(available on each listed item), then item gets deleted from the user list. Once cart is empty, user can get following message-'Cart is empty'.
